# The story behind the project
This projects contains a bunch of summaries about computer science topics. The project started when I was studying for my Ph.D. qualifying exam back in 2010. I needed a way to quickly refresh my mind on a lot of material so I decided to make summaries. After I passed the exam I shared these notes with a bunch of other students. They found them useful but I never considered touching them again until I found them useful when preparing  for an interview. If these summaries helped me, they could help someone else, plus it would be cool to tinker with them as a side project.

# Contributing
As you might have noticed there are a bunch of topics that are not covered yet. Feel free to take a stab at them. As you might have noticed I used LyX (an excellent frontend for LaTeX) to create all these summaries so it would be nice to keep the tradition going. :)
