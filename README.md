# The story behind the project
This projects contains summaries about a bunch of computer science topics. The project started when I was studying for my Ph.D. qualifying exam back in 2010. I needed a way to quickly refresh my mind on a lot of material so I decided to make summaries. After I passed the exam I shared my notes with a bunch of other students but never touched them again until my first interview. Then I thought: if they helped me, they could help someone else, plus it would be cool to tinker with them as a side project. So here they are.
